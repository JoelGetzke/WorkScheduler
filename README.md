# WorkScheduler

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my a work day planner for a full day with data that would save beyond refresh page and color coded for past, present and future time areas.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* Better grasp on how functions work.
* Better grasp on DOM Transversal and DOM in general
* How conveient jquery can be.
* How to set and get localstorage.
* That with time and practice I could become a good coder.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* Knowing where to start but i finished!
* getting used to technical concepts on logic
 ## Instalation
